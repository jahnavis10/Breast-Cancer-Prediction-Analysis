## Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Analysis

This notebook presents a complete machine learning workflow for breast cancer prediction using Python. The process includes data preprocessing, EDA, model training, and evaluation.

**Key Tools Used:**
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib for visualization
- Scikit-learn for modeling

**Outcome:** Achieved a strong classification model that predicts tumor type with high accuracy using Logistic Regression.
